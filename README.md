How to Participate
------------------

Bring in ideas:

1. Create a valid issue.
2. Discuss the issues with other people

Write Code:

1. Read the [issues](https://github.com/codeshows/codeshows.github.io/issues) in this project (Issues in the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/codeshows/codeshows.github.io/labels/good%20first%20issue) label are a good starting point).
2. If you want to work on an issue mention in the issue discussion that you want to work on it. You can collaborate with multiple people on a single issue. Make good use of github's fork and merge mechanism.
3. As soon as you have code which attempts to solve an issue, submit a merge request to the project's master branch so that others can look at it and learn from it.
4. Improve your code as per feedback until the merge request is accepted.

Review Code:

1. Pick up a merge request on the project.
2. Go through the code.
3. If something is not clear, ask for clarification. If someone has already asked just thumbs up that comment.
4. Add an approving comment saying "Good work!". If someone has already commented thumbs up on that.
